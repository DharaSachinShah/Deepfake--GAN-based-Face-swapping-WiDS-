# Deepfake--GAN-based-Face-swapping-WiDS

My Project of WiDS, Winter in Data Science under Analytics Club

This project, titled "Deepfakes: GAN-based Face-swapping," is a comprehensive journey through the realms of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). It begins with an in-depth review of pivotal research papers on AttGAN and Deepfakes, providing participants with a solid theoretical foundation. Moving forward, the project delves into fundamental GAN concepts and architectures, paving the way for hands-on implementation of AttGAN for facial attribute editing. The exploration extends to the ethical considerations surrounding Deepfakes, fostering a critical perspective on responsible use and societal impacts.

Throughout this project, I leverage popular Python libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch for practical implementation, enhancing my proficiency in deep learning frameworks. By the end of this journey, I emerge with a nuanced understanding of GANs, practical skills in AttGAN implementation, and insights into the ethical dimensions of Deepfakesâ€”an enriching experience in the cutting-edge field of facial attribute editing.
